World of Everbies

	
Project idea and description:
The project we've chosen is a version of the classic Tamagotchi. But with a more 
urban direction, with aspects such as nightlife and combat. Furthermore there 
will be a different growth system in the form of levels. Then which type of 
character your creature (which we call an Everbie) will develop is up to the way 
you choose to take care of it, so you can never be sure what your pet will 
become.

	Motivated License:
GPL: Because we reckon that our game should be enjoyed both the way it is but 
also open up the opportunity to make modifications to further enhance World of 
Everbies.

	Features that we think we'll manage:
We will start of quite simple by only have an image of the creature you are 
currently taking care of. The menu button will contain a menu of different 
actions you can do but for starters we will only have the action feed. 
There will also be stats for the creature that will change depending on your 
actions. We will later add more actions, more creatures and more stats, such as 
the possibility to give your pet a dumbbell to increase its strengh, or let it 
take a walk to the city for a chance to meet other Everbies.
